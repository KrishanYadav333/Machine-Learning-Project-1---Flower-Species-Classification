# Flower Classification Model

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for classifying flowers using a machine learning approach. The notebook demonstrates data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation to predict the type of flower from a given dataset.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleansing and preparing data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing patterns and distributions in the dataset.
- **Feature Engineering**: Optimizing features to improve model performance.
- **Model Training**: Training classification models using algorithms such as [specify algorithms if any].
- **Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the trained model with metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - scikit-learn

To install the required libraries, run:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <https://github.com/KrishanYadav333/Machine-Learning-Project-1---Flower-Species-Classification>
   ```
2. Navigate to the directory:
   ```bash
   cd <Machine Learning Project 1 - Flower Species Classification>
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Flower_Classification.ipynb
   ```
4. Follow the cells sequentially to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## Dataset
The notebook uses a dataset of flowers with features like petal length, petal width, etc., to classify flower types. Ensure the dataset is available in the correct path as specified in the notebook.

## Results
The notebook provides detailed results, including:
- Visualizations of the data.
- Model accuracy and other evaluation metrics.
- Confusion matrix for classification.
